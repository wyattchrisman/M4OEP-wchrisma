# Slide Puzzle Game - Wyatt Chrisman
   * I created a slide puzzle game that allows the user to choose from 3 difficulties which adjust the size of the puzzle
      * How the game works:
        * All boxes are drawn for each mode 
        * Keyboard listeners
          * Up, down, left, right to move the slide puzzle
          * 'e', 'm', 'h' for difficulty
          * Timer to see how long the user took
          * Graphics with object classes - Quad and Button

   * Future work (how I plan to expand the program )
      * Allow the user to add a picture that turns into a slide puzzle
      * More sizes/difficulties
      * Add more games - have it as sort-of a game hub
      * Make sure that no impossible puzzles are created
