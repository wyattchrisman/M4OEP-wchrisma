Module4 Open ended project

CS 120 Module 4 Open-Ended Project
For this project, you will design, implement, test, and use a C++ project with concepts from Module 4.
Requirements

  * Your README.md file should include:
    * Your name(s)
      * Wyatt Chrisman
    * A summary of your program, including a list of Module 4 concepts used 
      * I created a slide puzzle game that allows the user to choose from 3 difficulties which adjust the size of the puzzle
      * Some topics that I used were:
        * Drawing all the boxes for each mode
        * Keyboard listeners
          * Up, down, left, right to move the slide puzzle
          * 'e', 'm', 'h' for difficulty
          * Timer to see how long the user took
          * Graphics with classes - Quad and Button

    * Any known bugs at time of submission 
      * The puzzle can be created impossible 
      * https://gamingph.com/blackdesertmobile/puzzle/puzzle.html 
      * This was the website that i used to get solutions for the puzzles and to see if it was impossible
    * Future work (how you could expand the program with more time)
      * Allow the user to add a picture that turns into a slide puzzle
      * More sizes/difficulties
      * Add more games - have it as sortof a game hub
      * Make sure that no impossible puzzles are created
    * Citations for any code not written by you or the instructor 
    * The grade you think you have earned, based on the grading rubric below, with justification
    |Module 4 Topic Added||
  * Your main program should have a clear and complex purpose. The goals and functionality of your program should inform the development and design of your class(es) and other concepts. You are highly encouraged to plan and design your main.cpp functionality before writing your other files. Put an add_executable line in CMakeLists.txt to create an executable for your main program. The program should be interactive and all user input must be validated.


| Grading Category                      | Points Deserved | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                 | 
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Main program complexity and usability | 35/40           | Added user validation to only allow user to interact with games on their respective screen                                                                |
| Keyboard listeners                    | 40/10           | Used up, down, left, right to move the slide puzzle and 'e', 'm', 'h' for difficulty as well as a timer to see how long the user took to solve the puzzle |
| Class used with graphics              | 20/10           | Used Quad and Button                                                                                                                                      |
